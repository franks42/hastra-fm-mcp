 Tips for getting started:

 1. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 2. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 3. ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> /init is analyzing your codebase… 

⏺ I'll analyze the codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file for this repository. Let me start by exploring the structure
  and understanding the project.

     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
     ## Development Commands
     ### Development and Testing
     - **Development**: `uv run pywrangler dev` - Run the worker locally for development
     - **Testing**: `uv run pytest tests` - Run the test suite
     - **Linting**: `uv ruff check .` - Check for linting issues

⏺ I've successfully created a CLAUDE.md file for your hastra-fm-mcp repository. The file includes:

  Key sections covered:

  - Development Commands - All the essential commands for development, testing, linting, and deployment
  - Project Architecture - High-level overview of the MCP server for Figure Markets/Provenance Blockchain
  - Core Components - Description of the main files and their purposes
  - Key Architecture Details - FastMCP framework, async HTTP patterns, error handling, and Cloudflare Workers
  deployment
  - MCP Tools Structure - Overview of the tools exposed by the server
  - Dependencies - Production and development requirements
  - Configuration - Python version, Ruff settings, and Cloudflare configuration

  The documentation focuses on the essential information that future Claude Code instances will need to work
  effectively with this codebase, including the specific development workflow using uv and pywrangler, the MCP server
  architecture, and the blockchain/exchange integration patterns.

⏺ Here's my review of utils.py:

  Code Quality & Structure

  The file is well-organized with clear sections for datetime utilities, amount/denomination handling, and HTTP client
  functionality.

  Potential Issues & Improvements

  1. Type Annotations (lines 18, 25, 29, 40, 48)

  Several functions lack proper type annotations:
  - datetime_to_ms(dt) should be datetime_to_ms(dt: datetime) -> int
  - ms_to_datetime should specify ms_timestamp: int
  - current_ms() should return -> int
  - is_same_denom should type the parameters
  - amount_denom_add return type annotation is malformed

  2. Import Optimization (lines 1-8)

  Some imports appear unused:
  - asyncio is imported but not used
  - json is imported but not used
  - sys is imported but not used

  3. Amount/Denomination Type Safety (lines 33-55)

  The comment on line 33 has a typo ('amount:' should be 'amount'). The amount/denomination functions could benefit
  from:
  - A proper TypedDict or dataclass for the AmountDenom type
  - More descriptive variable names (a_d → amount_denom)
  - The return type annotation on line 48 is invalid Python syntax

  4. Exception Handling (line 54)

  Using generic Exception instead of a more specific custom exception type makes error handling less precise.

  5. HTTP Function Design (lines 59-105)

  The async_http_get_json function is well-implemented with proper error handling and timeout configuration. The error
  response pattern with "MCP-ERROR" key is consistent throughout the codebase.

  6. Code Style (line 41)

  Missing space after colon in the conditional: if not is_amount_denom_type(amt) : return False

  Strengths

  - Comprehensive error handling in the HTTP function
  - Consistent error response format
  - Proper timeout configuration
  - Good separation of concerns
  - Timezone-aware datetime handling

  Recommendations

  1. Add proper type annotations to all functions
  2. Remove unused imports
  3. Fix the malformed return type annotation on line 48
  4. Consider using a TypedDict or dataclass for amount/denomination structures
  5. Create custom exception classes for better error handling
  6. Fix minor style issues (spacing)

  The code is functional and follows good patterns, but could benefit from better type safety and cleanup of unused
  imports.
