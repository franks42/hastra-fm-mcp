**üí° Glossary Function: Ask me to define any term you don't understand - I can explain blockchain, DeFi, and Figure Markets terminology in simple terms.**

---

### Market Data & Asset Information *(No wallet address needed)*

#### Current Prices & Trading Data
- "What's the current HASH price and recent trading activity?"
- "Show me current prices for all assets on Figure Markets"
- "What trading pairs are available on Figure Markets?"
- "How has HASH been performing lately?"
- "What's the price history for HASH-USD over the last few trades?"

#### Market Overview

---

### Portfolio Analysis & Valuation

#### Complete Portfolio Assessment
- "Analyze my wallet pb1abc123... and show me my complete HASH breakdown"
- "Analyze my combined portfolio across wallets pb1abc123... and pb1def456..."
- "What's my total portfolio value including staked HASH?" 
- "Why does Figure Markets show a different value than my actual total portfolio?"
- "Show me all my assets on Figure Markets with accurate valuations"

**Critical Issue**: Figure Markets' AUM excludes staked/delegated HASH, significantly understating portfolio values for active stakers. The AI calculates your true total value.

#### Asset Allocation Analysis
- "What percentage of my portfolio is HASH vs other assets?"
- "How should I rebalance between HASH, ETH, and USDC?"
- "What's my risk exposure across different assets?"
- "Should I convert some liquid assets to HASH for staking?"

---

### HASH-Specific Analysis

#### Available vs Controllable HASH *(Critical Distinction)*
- "How much HASH can I actually trade right now?"
- "What's my controllable vs total HASH holdings?"
- "Do I have any vesting restrictions on my HASH?"
- "How does delegation affect my available HASH amounts?"

**Why This Matters**: Many tools incorrectly show all owned HASH as "available" when vesting or delegation restrictions apply. This can lead to major miscalculations.

#### Vesting Analysis *(Most wallets don't have vesting)*
- "Do I have any vesting restrictions limiting my HASH?"
- "What's my liquidity timeline as vesting restrictions lift?"
- "How does delegation provide 'coverage' for my vesting requirements?"
- "When will specific amounts of HASH become fully available?"

---

### Delegation & Staking Optimization

#### Current Delegation Status
- "How much HASH do I have delegated to validators?"
- "Show me my complete delegation breakdown with earning vs non-earning buckets"
- "What rewards have I accumulated but not claimed?"
- "Which of my HASH is earning rewards vs sitting idle?"

#### ROI Optimization *(Common missed opportunities)*
- "Am I losing money by not claiming accumulated rewards?"
- "How much ROI am I missing with my current delegation strategy?"
- "Should I claim my rewards and redelegate them for compound growth?"
- "What's my optimal delegation strategy for maximum returns?"
- "How much extra could I earn if I optimized my delegation buckets?"

**Key Insight**: Unclaimed rewards don't earn compound interest. The AI identifies these missed opportunities and calculates potential gains from optimization.

---

### Market Position & Influence

#### Reality Check *(Prevents major calculation errors)*
- "What's my actual market influence based on controllable vs total HASH?"
- "Am I really a whale, or do vesting restrictions limit my market power?"
- "How much trading power do I actually have for market-moving decisions?"
- "What percentage of circulating supply can I realistically control?"
- "Calculate my true whale status using controllable HASH only"

**Critical Error Prevention**: Most analyses incorrectly use total HASH holdings, leading to 10-100x overstatement of actual market influence. The AI uses controllable HASH for accurate assessments.

#### Strategic Positioning
- "How does my position compare to other large HASH holders?"
- "What's my realistic influence in governance and market decisions?"
- "How do my holdings affect my strategic options?"

---

### Investment Strategy & Portfolio Management

#### Asset Allocation
- "What percentage of my portfolio is HASH vs other assets?"
- "How should I rebalance between HASH, ETH, and USDC?"
- "What's my risk exposure across different assets?"
- "Should I convert some liquid assets to HASH for staking?"

#### Strategic Coordination
- "How should I balance HASH staking rewards vs liquid asset trading?"
- "What's my optimal asset mix for my risk tolerance and liquidity needs?"
- "How do my HASH holdings affect my overall portfolio risk profile?"

---

### Timing & Liquidity Planning

#### Advanced Liquidity Questions
- "When will I have enough liquid HASH for a major purchase?"
- "How do the 21-day unbonding periods affect my investment timeline?"
- "What's my cash flow forecast as HASH vests over time?"
- "How much HASH should I keep liquid vs delegate for optimal flexibility?"

#### Strategic Timing *(Understanding complex blockchain mechanics)*
- "I have HASH in redelegation - when will it become fully flexible again?"
- "What's the opportunity cost of unbonding HASH vs waiting for redelegation to complete?"
- "When should I claim rewards vs let them accumulate?"
- "How do redelegation waiting periods affect my investment options?"

**Technical Detail**: Redelegated HASH automatically becomes fully flexible staked HASH after 21 days with no user action required.

---

### Error Prevention & Validation *(Critical for avoiding costly mistakes)*

#### Calculation Verification
- "Double-check my HASH calculations - do the numbers add up correctly?"
- "Why might my available HASH show as negative?"
- "Validate my delegation totals against the blockchain state"
- "Are there any errors in my portfolio breakdown?"
- "Check if my vesting coverage logic is calculated properly"

**Error Prevention**: The AI prevents common calculation mistakes that can lead to poor investment decisions. Negative available HASH amounts typically indicate vesting coverage calculation errors.

#### Data Consistency
- "Are my wallet amounts consistent across different data sources?"
- "Why do I see discrepancies in my HASH totals?"
- "Verify my portfolio calculations against live blockchain data"

---

### Network Analysis

#### Comparative Analysis
- "How do my staking returns compare to network averages?"
- "What's the typical delegation strategy for wallets my size?"
- "Show me HASH network statistics and where I fit"
- "Compare my portfolio to other large HASH holders"

---

### Advanced Strategic Analysis

#### Multi-Part Comprehensive Analysis
"Analyze wallet pb1abc123... and tell me: (1) my complete HASH breakdown including controllable vs total amounts, (2) any delegation optimization opportunities I'm missing, (3) my realistic market influence vs what it appears to be, and (4) recommended next steps for maximizing returns while maintaining liquidity."

#### ROI Optimization Focus
"I want to maximize my HASH returns. Show me: (1) which of my HASH buckets are earning vs not earning rewards, (2) how much I could gain by claiming and restaking rewards, (3) optimal delegation strategy, and (4) timeline for implementing changes considering waiting periods."

#### Strategic Liquidity Planning
"I need $100K liquid in 3 months. Based on my vesting schedule, delegation status, and unbonding periods, what's the best strategy to ensure I have sufficient controllable HASH available while minimizing opportunity cost?"

#### Market Position Reality Check
"Calculate my true market influence: (1) total HASH owned vs controllable HASH, (2) percentage of circulating supply I can actually move, (3) realistic whale status assessment, and (4) how vesting restrictions affect my trading power."

## Example Conversation with your AI Assistant

Here's how a typical interaction might unfold. Note that while the AI will provide the same factual information about your portfolio, actual responses will vary based on your previous questions, current market conditions, your specific portfolio status, the AI agent you're working with, your question's tone and complexity, and the conversation context.

***User:*** *"I'm new to this. What exactly is HASH and why would I want to stake it?"*

**AI-Assistant:** 
> "HASH is the utility token of the Provenance Blockchain. It's used for transaction fees, governance voting, and securing the network through staking. When you stake HASH, you delegate it to validators who process transactions and maintain the blockchain. In return, you earn staking rewards - typically 8-12% annually. Think of it like earning interest, but you're also helping secure the network."

***User:*** *"That makes sense. Can you analyze my wallet pb1abc123def and show me what I currently have?"*

**AI-Assistant:** 
> "I'll analyze your wallet now. Here's what I found:
> 
> **Portfolio Summary:**
> - Total HASH Holdings: 150,000 HASH ($3,900)
> - Available to Trade: 25,000 HASH 
> - Currently Staked: 100,000 HASH (earning rewards)
> - Accumulated Rewards: 2,500 HASH (not earning additional rewards)
> - Unbonding: 22,500 HASH (6 days remaining)
> 
> **Other Assets:**
> - USDC: $5,000
> - ETH: 0.8 ETH ($2,400)
> 
> **Total Portfolio Value: $11,300**
> 
> Note: Figure Markets AUM shows $8,900 because it excludes your staked HASH."

***User:*** *"Why aren't my accumulated rewards earning more rewards?"*

**AI-Assistant:** 
> "Great question! This is a common optimization opportunity. Your 2,500 HASH in accumulated rewards just sits there - it doesn't earn compound interest until you claim it and restake it. 
> 
> If you claim and restake those rewards, they'll start earning ~10% annually. That's about 250 HASH per year you're currently missing out on. I recommend claiming rewards regularly and immediately restaking them for maximum compound growth."

***User:*** *"How do I know if I'm really a whale with 150,000 HASH?"*

**AI-Assistant:** 
> "Let me calculate your actual market influence. With 150,000 total HASH, you might think you control a significant portion, but let's look at what you can actually control:
> 
> **Market Position Analysis:**
> - Total HASH Owned: 150,000 HASH
> - Controllable HASH: 127,500 HASH (excludes 22,500 unbonding)
> - Percentage of Circulating Supply: ~0.04%
> - Whale Status: Medium holder (not whale level)
> 
> You have a solid position but aren't at whale status yet. True whales typically control 0.1%+ of circulating supply."

***User:*** *"What should I do to optimize my returns over the next 3 months?"*

**AI-Assistant:** 
> "Based on your wallet analysis, here's my recommended 3-month strategy:
> 
> **Immediate Actions (This Week):**
> 1. Claim your 2,500 HASH rewards and restake them (+$250 value earning 10% annually)
> 2. Wait for your 22,500 HASH to finish unbonding (6 days)
> 
> **Month 1:**
> - Once unbonding completes, decide: keep liquid for opportunities or restake for rewards
> - Consider your liquidity needs - you'll have 47,500 HASH available
> 
> **Months 2-3:**
> - Monitor your delegation performance across validators
> - Set up a routine to claim and restake rewards monthly
> - Potential annual gain from optimization: ~500-750 additional HASH
> 
> **Risk Considerations:**
> - Keep some HASH liquid for opportunities
> - Remember: 21-day unbonding period limits quick access
> - Don't stake everything if you might need quick liquidity"

***User:*** *"Can you double-check these calculations? I want to make sure they're accurate."*

**AI-Assistant:** 
> "Absolutely! Let me validate the key calculations:
> 
> **‚úÖ Portfolio Math Check:**
> - Available (25,000) + Staked (100,000) + Rewards (2,500) + Unbonding (22,500) = 150,000 ‚úì
> - Controllable HASH: 150,000 - 22,500 (unbonding) = 127,500 ‚úì
> - Market share: 127,500 / ~300M circulating = 0.043% ‚úì
> 
> **‚úÖ ROI Opportunity:**
> - Unclaimed rewards: 2,500 HASH not earning compound interest ‚úì
> - Potential annual gain: 2,500 √ó 10% = 250 HASH ‚úì
> 
> **‚úÖ Portfolio Valuation:**
> - Total value includes staked HASH (often missed by other tools) ‚úì
> - Figure Markets AUM excludes staked amounts (common limitation) ‚úì
> 
> All calculations verified against live blockchain data. The numbers are accurate."
